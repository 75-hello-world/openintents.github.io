Having contributed to the Android app of [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) back in 2015 (adding [basic support for Android Auto](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk/pull/20)) it feels great to get involved again. 

Today, we launched OI Chat, a Matrix service dedicated to Blockstack users. As explained in the post [Giving Internet Permission](https://www.openintents.org/blog/2018-12-09-giving-internet-permission.md), Blockstack is a platform for decentralized apps. It provides a decentralized identity that comes with user-owned storage. [OI ConvertCSV](https://convertcsv.openitnents.org) and [OI Timesheet](https://oi-timesheet.com) benefit from it already. However, when I talk about Blockstack I mention two parts that are still missing in the platform: 
1. Decentralized Communication
1. P2P Payment

I think that Matrix is to chat what Gaia is to storage, therefore, we invested in OI Chat to bring both parts together. The result is 
* a matrix server that does not rely on or store any passwords anymore, 
* a matrix client that simplifies login for Blockstack users, and
* a tool to generate one-time logins for alternative matrix clients.
