[OI Calendar](https://cal.openintents.org) now integrates with [SpringRole](http://springrole.com/) for enriched notifications. This integration now allows users of OI Calendar to get access to the enriched profile of the person who they've set up a call/meet with. On OI Calendar when users specify the Blockstack ID, SpringRole pulls up the verified professional profile of the same user if they've connected their Blockstack account on the SpringRole platform.

OI Calendar now integrates with SpringRole through enriched notifications. This integration allows users of OI Calendar to receive conveniently the full profile of the person who they've set up a call/meet with. Guests can be added to events by their Blockstack ID and SpringRole pulls up the verified professional profile of the same user if they've connected their Blockstack ID on the SpringRole platform.

Both OI Calendar and SpringRole rely on [Blockstack identities](https://docs.blockstack.org) which ensures that users's data is completely owned by them and is in their control.
