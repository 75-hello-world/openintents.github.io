At the first #mygaligleo hackathon, that engaged developers to make use of the Galileo satellite system, Friedger MÃ¼ffke was part 
of the winning team "Rover Movers" of the Galilo Impact Award. 

The developed application "Life Watch" encourages users to 
take care and responsibility of their neighborhood. The precise location information provided by the modern GNSS allows to identify
