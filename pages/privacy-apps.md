Your privacy is very important to us and we want you to know everything we do
and don’t do with the information you provide. Our guiding principle is that
we collect as little information as necessary (and in most cases this means no
information at all) and that any information we collect from you will be
treated with the utmost care and respect, and every effort will be made to ensure
the information is kept private.

access the Application, and delete it from the device on which the Application
was installed (the "device").
