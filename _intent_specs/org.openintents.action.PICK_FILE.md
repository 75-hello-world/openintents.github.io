Pick a file through a file manager.

The picked file URI can be obtained in `onActivityResult()` through `getData()`.

Details can be found in the sample application [TestFileManager](https://github.com/openintents/filemanager/tree/master/FileManagerDemo) in the public repository.

You may want to use the [OI File Manager intent definition file](https://github.com/openintents/filemanager/blob/master/FileManagerDemo/src/org/openintents/intents/FileManagerIntents.java).
