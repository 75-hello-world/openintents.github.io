This intention is used to allow X11 applications to be able to launch an X server as a prerrequisite for other applications. The URI is specified as, for example, x11://localhost:6000, where usually localhost is the bind address and 6000 means a port number ... An uri of x11://localhost:6100 would usually mean that the environment variable DISPLAY for the application would have been set to DISPLAY=localhost:100.
