Simulates an android.intent.action.VIEW intent on a remote machine.

Although the remote machine may not be running Android, it may be controlled remotely by an Android application. 
For example, an Android application for controlling a media center may instruct the media center to open a file that is stored locally on the media center. 
The data URI would be interpreted relative to the remote machine. For example, a file:// URI would always refer to a file on the media center, not a file on the SD card of the device controlling the media center.
