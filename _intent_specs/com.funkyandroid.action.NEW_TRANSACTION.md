This intent reports a financial transaction to be recorded in an expenses or banking application.

This is used, for example, by BistroMath to report the amount it has calculated for a persons tip to Funky Expenses for recording in the persons expenses account.

It is recommended that the intent brings up a page which allows the user to confirm the transaction 
before it is recorded in order to prevent malicious applications filling an expenses/banking application with junk entries and to allow the user to fill in any missing information.
