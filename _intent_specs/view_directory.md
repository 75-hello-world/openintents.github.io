This intention is used to allow 3rd party apps to direct the user to a files directory.

The uri can be used by the (file manager) app to retrieve the display name of the folder.
It is the responsibility of the (file manager) app to decide whether it can display the directory 
or not (due to missing permissions or unknown location).
